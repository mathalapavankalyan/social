# social
Social is a modern communication platform designed to help people connect and share. Users can chat, discover others with similar hobbies, and express their lifestyle. The project is powered by Kafka for real-time communication, JWT for secure authentication, Spring Boot for backend services, and React + Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
